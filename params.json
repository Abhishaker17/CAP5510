Planted Motif Search can be described as a method of identifying conserved substring of length l that occurs in a set of input sequences with up to d mismatches. Many versions of motif search problems have been studied intensively, but we shall focus on PMS.\r\n\r\n#### Protein Motif Search Problem\r\nPMS, which has been well studied, is though to be a NP-hard problem. There are two types of algorithmic categories with regards to PMS i.e. approximation algorithms and exact algorithms. Approximation algorithms are generally faster than exact algorithms, which have an exponential worst case complexity. While exact algorithms for the motif problem take longer to complete, they guarantee to find all motifs. But due to their exponential time complexity, it is impractical to run these algorithms on very large instances. \r\n\r\n####Implementation\r\nThis project will implement a OS X based application implementing Protein Motif Search Prune algorithm, which is based on the idea of PMS1 algorithm. Current implementations take a console based approach. With the help of Cocoa API and the powerful Clang compiler, it will now be possible to group and visualize data in an intelligible manner.\r\n\r\n## Plan of Action\r\n\r\n\r\n> - Understand the different **motif sequence search** algorithms through papers and available literature.\r\n> - Correspond with the paper's authors if clarification is needed.\r\n> - Implement the algorithm in **Objective-C/Swift** and compile it with the Clang compiler.\r\n> - **Test** it against manual input of different sizes. After successful testing, test it with actual nucleotide sequences. Test it for correctness and result quality.\r\n> - **Compare** the result and performance against existing implementations (obtainable through GitHub) such as:\r\n> > - PMS1\r\n> > - qPMS2\r\n\r\nMost of the effort will go into making this interactive, once the initial challenge of implementing the algorithm is completed.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Journals/Papers\r\n\r\nPaper     | Authors\r\n-------- | ---\r\nExperimental Comparison of PMSPrune and Other Algorithms for Motif Search | `Sharma, Rajasekaran, Dinh`\r\nFast and practical algorithms for planted (l, d) motif search    | `Davila, Balla, Rajasekaran`\r\nExact algorithms for planted motif challenge problems     | `Rajasekaran, Balla, C.-H Huang`\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n## Contact\r\nabhishekbanthia@ufl.edu\r\n@Abhishaker17\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
